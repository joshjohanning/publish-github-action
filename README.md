This action creates a release branch for your GitHub Actions which will be automatically tagged and released. The release version can be defined in `package.json`.

Based on the [tgymnich/publish-github-action](https://github.com/tgymnich/publish-github-action) action, but I wanted further customization and control over the release process (i.e.: adding `ncc` output and not committing `node_modules` directory).

## Features

- üîê **Verified Commits** - Uses GitHub API to create verified commits (when `commit_node_modules` is `false`)
- üè∑Ô∏è **Annotated Tags** - Creates annotated tags via Git CLI with atomic updates (no downtime)
- üåê **Multi-instance Support** - API URL defaults to the environment you are running in; works with GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Server, and GHE.com
- üì¶ **Flexible Build** - Automatically installs production dependencies and supports custom build commands
- üóÇÔ∏è **Selective Commits** - Choose which files to include (dist, node_modules, or both)

| `github_api_url`         | GitHub API URL (e.g., `https://api.github.com` for GitHub.com or `https://ghes.domain.com/api/v3` for GHES)                                       | No       | `${{ github.api_url }}` |

| `commit_node_modules`    | Whether to commit `node_modules` folder. **Note:** When set to `true`, commits will NOT be verified due to API limitations with large file counts | No       | `false`                 |
| `commit_dist_folder`     | Whether to commit `dist` folder                                                                                                                   | No       | `true`                  |

### Commit Signing Behavior

- ‚úÖ **Verified commits** (signed by GitHub) when `commit_node_modules: false` - Uses GitHub API for commits; tags are created locally via Git CLI
- ‚ùå **Unverified commits** when `commit_node_modules: true` - Uses Git CLI due to API limitations with large file counts

### Build and File Management

The action automatically handles clean builds and file management:

- **Dist folder cleaning**: When `commit_dist_folder: true` and `npm_package_command` is specified, the `dist/` folder is cleaned before building to ensure no stale files persist
- **Automatic file deletion**: The action removes `.github/` files from release commits and properly handles renamed/deleted files in the `dist/` folder

## Example Workflow

```yml
name: 'Publish GitHub Action'
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - name: install ncc
        run: npm i -g @vercel/ncc
      - uses: joshjohanning/publish-github-action@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          npm_package_command: npm run package
          commit_node_modules: false
          commit_dist_folder: true # defaults to true
          publish_minor_version: false
          publish_release_branch: false
```
