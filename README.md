This action creates a release branch for your GitHub Actions which will be automatically tagged and released. The release version can be defined in `package.json`.

Based on the [tgymnich/publish-github-action](https://github.com/tgymnich/publish-github-action) action, but I wanted further customization and control over the release process (i.e.: adding `ncc` output and not committing `node_modules` directory).

## Features

- 🔐 **Verified Commits** - Uses GitHub API to create verified commits (when `commit_node_modules` is `false`)
- 🏷️ **Annotated Tags** - Creates annotated tags via Git CLI with atomic updates (no downtime)
- 🌐 **Multi-instance Support** - API URL defaults to the environment you are running in; works with GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Server, and GHE.com
- 📦 **Flexible Build** - Automatically installs production dependencies and supports custom build commands
- 🗂️ **Selective Commits** - Choose which files to include (dist, node_modules, or both)

### Commit Signing Behavior

- ✅ **Verified commits** (signed by GitHub) when `commit_node_modules: false` - Uses GitHub API for commits; tags are created locally via Git CLI
- ❌ **Unverified commits** when `commit_node_modules: true` - Uses Git CLI due to API limitations with large file counts

### Build and File Management

The action automatically handles clean builds and file management:

- **Dist folder cleaning**: When `commit_dist_folder: true` and `npm_package_command` is specified, the `dist/` folder is cleaned before building to ensure no stale files persist
- **Automatic file deletion**: The action removes `.github/` files from release commits and properly handles renamed/deleted files in the `dist/` folder

## Example Workflow

> [!NOTE]
> The `install ncc` step is only needed if `@vercel/ncc` is not in your `package.json` devDependencies. If you already have it as a dev dependency, you can skip this step.

```yml
name: 'Publish GitHub Action'
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - name: install ncc
        run: npm i -g @vercel/ncc
      - uses: joshjohanning/publish-github-action@v2
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          npm_package_command: npm run package
          commit_node_modules: false
          commit_dist_folder: true
          publish_minor_version: false
          publish_release_branch: false
          create_release_as_draft: false
```
